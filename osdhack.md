# 🎨 retro-paint - Open Source Days Hackathon Submission

*A nostalgic meme creation studio that brings back the golden age of MS Paint with modern collaborative features*

---

## 💡 Inspiration

Remember the days when creating memes was an art form? When MS Paint was the weapon of choice for crafting rage comics, reaction images, and those beautifully crude drawings that defined early internet culture? We were inspired by the pure joy and creativity that came from those simple tools.

Our inspiration came from multiple sources:
- **Nostalgia for Windows 98 era** - The chunky buttons, system sounds, and that distinctive retro aesthetic
- **Early meme culture** - Rage comics, stick figures, and the raw creativity of pre-Instagram internet
- **Collaborative creativity** - The magic that happens when friends create something together in real-time
- **Modern AI potential** - Imagining how AI could enhance rather than replace human creativity
- **Open source spirit** - Making creative tools accessible to everyone, just like the original Paint

We wanted to bridge the gap between nostalgia and modern technology, creating something that feels familiar yet surprisingly powerful. The goal was to capture that feeling of opening MS Paint for the first time, but with the collaborative features we wish we had back then.
