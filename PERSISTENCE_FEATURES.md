# Canvas Persistence & Collaboration Enhancement

## 🎯 Problem Solved
- ❌ Canvas lost on page refresh
- ❌ Users getting isolated in separate rooms
- ❌ Unstable WebSocket connections with rapid reconnects
- ❌ Random usernames causing connection churn

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 🔄 Canvas Persistence
- **localStorage Integration**: Canvas automatically saves on every change
- **Smart Restoration**: Checks localStorage first, then server state
- **Conflict Resolution**: Server state takes precedence when newer
- **24-hour Cache**: Automatic cleanup of stale data

### 👤 Stable User Identity  
- **Persistent Usernames**: Generated once, saved across sessions
- **Unique User IDs**: Stable identity for presence tracking
- **Creative Names**: "RetroArtist42", "PixelMaster77" style usernames

### 🏠 Default Shared Room
- **Single Collaboration Space**: All users join "default-collaboration-room"
- **No More Isolation**: Eliminates individual room creation on connect
- **Seamless Collaboration**: Immediate shared drawing experience

### 🔗 Enhanced Connection Management
- **Exponential Backoff**: Smart reconnection with increasing delays
- **Connection Cleanup**: Proper disconnect handling
- **Room Persistence**: Remember last joined room

### 🧹 Room Management
- **Auto Cleanup**: Empty rooms deleted after 5 minutes
- **Default Room Protected**: Main collaboration space never deleted
- **Memory Efficiency**: Prevents room accumulation

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Frontend (`src/utils/persistence.ts`)
```typescript
class PersistenceManager {
  saveCanvas(imageData, history, historyIndex)
  loadCanvas() // Returns saved canvas or null
  getOrCreateUserId() // Stable user identity
  getOrCreateUsername() // Persistent creative names
}
```

### Backend Enhancements
- Default room creation instead of individual rooms
- Room cleanup goroutines for empty rooms
- Canvas state persistence per room
- User session management

### Smart Canvas Restoration
1. **Page Load**: Check localStorage for saved canvas
2. **Room Join**: Compare local vs server timestamps
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Use newer state, update localStorage
4. **Auto-Save**: Every drawing action saves to localStorage

## 🧪 Testing the Features

1. **Start Backend**: `cd backend && go run main.go`
2. **Start Frontend**: `npm run dev`
3. **Test Persistence**:
   - Draw something
   - Refresh page → Canvas restored ✅
   - Open new tab → Same canvas shared ✅
4. **Test Collaboration**:
   - Multiple users see each other's cursors ✅
   - Real-time drawing synchronization ✅
   - Stable usernames across sessions ✅

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (Issues)
```
User connects → Random username → New room created
Page refresh → Canvas lost → New random user
Multiple tabs → Isolated rooms → No collaboration  
Connection drop → Rapid reconnects → Server spam
```

### After (Enhanced)
```
User connects → Persistent username → Default shared room
Page refresh → Canvas restored → Same username
Multiple tabs → Shared default room → Real collaboration
Connection drop → Smart backoff → Clean reconnection
```

## 🎨 User Experience Impact

- **Seamless Persistence**: Work survives page refreshes
- **Immediate Collaboration**: No room setup needed
- **Stable Identity**: Recognizable usernames in sessions
- **Reliable Connections**: No more connection spam
- **Memory Efficient**: Automatic room cleanup

The platform now provides a true collaborative experience with persistence, stability, and smart conflict resolution!
